## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **.NET 8 / Blazor WebAssembly**
- **C#**
- **Bootstrap 5** for styling
- **HttpClient** for API calls
- **Custom Exception Middleware** for error handling
- **SWAPI.tech** API as the backend

## 🏗️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanjaybk1998/starwars.explorer.git
   cd starwars.explorer
   dotnet restore
   dotnet run
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to: [https://localhost:5001](https://localhost:5001)

## 📋 Notes
- The application uses [https://www.swapi.tech/](https://www.swapi.tech/) for all Star Wars data.
- Some API limitations (such as partial linking between resources) are handled gracefully.
- Global error handling ensures that users are informed of any API/server issues without application crashes.

- 🧠 Bonus Features
- **Global Exception Interceptor**:
Catches exceptions from all service calls and shows user-friendly error messages via toasts.
- **Dynamic Item Rendering**:
PaginatedListPage uses RenderFragment<T> to dynamically render different item cards (FilmCard, PlanetCard, CharacterCard).
- **Optimized API Requests**:
First-render optimization to prevent multiple redundant API hits.
- **Cross linking of pages**:
1. Films will display navigable planets and character data.
2. Character id's can further show character name on user demand of a button press
